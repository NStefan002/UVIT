                <br>
                <p>In April 1952, Billboard reported that Jack Lawrence and Sammy Fain had signed to compose the score.
                    In the following year, Disney decided the score should be based on Peter Tchaikovsky's Sleeping
                    Beauty Ballet, which rendered the songs Lawrence and Fain had written unusable except for "Once Upon
                    a Dream".
                    Walter Schumann was originally slated to be the film composer, but he left the project because of
                    creative differences with Disney.
                    George Bruns was recommended to replace Schumann by animator Ward Kimball.
                    Because of a musicians' strike, the musical score was recorded in Berlin, Germany with the Berlin
                    Symphony Orchestra from September 8 through November 25, 1958.</p>
